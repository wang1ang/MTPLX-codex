# Troubleshooting

Start with:

```bash
mtplx doctor --json
```

## `mlx` Missing

`doctor` should report missing MLX as an actionable runtime dependency issue, not as a traceback. Help, inspect, and init should still work.

## Model Refuses To Run

Run:

```bash
mtplx inspect model --model /path/or/repo --json
```

The model must be Tier 1 verified for normal v0.1 runs. Architecture-compatible unverified models require an explicit unsafe override and cannot be used for release claims.

## Slow Long Responses

This is a known v0.1-preview caveat. Use the benchmark output and profile name when filing an issue. Do not compare `--max` diagnostic runs against no-fan product claims.

## Server Binding

Binding to `0.0.0.0` should require an API key. Prefer localhost for local clients:

```bash
mtplx serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

For a non-localhost bind:

```bash
mtplx serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --api-key "$MTPLX_AUTH"
```

Clients should send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `X-API-Key: <key>`.

## `--max` Does Not Change Fans

Run:

```bash
mtplx max --status --json
```

If no supported thermal tool is detected, install ThermalForge or TG Pro and ensure the CLI is on `PATH`. MTPLX will not enable hidden spin-loop or clock-anchor fallbacks.
