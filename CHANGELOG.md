# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to MTPLX. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-10

The first full release: the native macOS app and the `mtplx` command line
working as one product. Full notes:
[mtplx.com/releases/notes/v1.0.0](https://mtplx.com/releases/notes/v1.0.0.html).

### Added

- Native macOS app with onboarding (hardware check, model pick, guided
  setup, tuning), a live speed dashboard (decode gauge, acceptance by
  depth, verify waterfall, activity), native chat with attachments and
  web search, Forge, the AIME benchmark, and agent launchers for
  OpenCode, Pi, Hermes, and Open WebUI.
- New model families: Step 3.5 and Step 3.7 Flash (with trained MTP
  adapters and selectable reasoning effort), Gemma 4 (assistant-pair
  drafting tuned by draft block size), and Qwen 3.6 MoE 35B-A3B
  (prequantized expert sidecars, normalized expert layouts, hard blocks
  on unrunnable layouts), alongside Qwen 3.5 4B and 9B.
- SSD session cache: a session's KV state persists to disk with enforced
  size caps and restores near-instantly across server restarts, with
  admin endpoints for inspection and archiving.
- Concurrency: continuous batching with presets, a scheduler mode, and
  explicit caps (`--max-active-requests`, `--decode-batch-max`,
  `--batch-wait-ms`).
- Smart fan mode across the app, CLI, and server API: ramps while the
  model works, restores on idle, survives client handoffs, and keeps the
  crash-safe restore watchdog.
- Forge: convert any Hugging Face repo to MLX (AWQ, compressed-tensors,
  NVFP4, BF16 sources), calibrate and train the MTP adapter, verify with
  quality gates that reject speed wins that degrade output, and publish
  with provenance. Vision towers are preserved through conversion. In
  the app and as `mtplx forge`.
- Agent-grade serving: hardened tool contracts and dedicated lanes for
  OpenCode, Pi, and Hermes; long-context depth policy; client identity
  tagging; a live server-sent metrics stream plus snapshot, thermal, and
  prefill-history endpoints; honest cancellation that stops decode.
- Automatic runtime setup during onboarding: the app installs its own
  Python engine, fan control (ThermalForge), and the `mtplx` terminal
  command without requiring Homebrew. Release builds bundle a pinned
  CPython interpreter, the engine environment ignores user pip
  configuration, and the interpreter is signed so installed packages
  load on macOS 14 and 15. A stale `mtplx` on PATH is updated
  automatically; a newer one is left alone.
- Official Apple Silicon model catalog (Qwen 3.5/3.6, Gemma 4 in speed,
  balance, and quality builds) with device-aware defaults shared by the
  app and the CLI: chip generation picks precision and machines under
  32 GiB route to the 9B model automatically.
- App-aware `mtplx start`: detects a running MTPLX server and attaches
  instead of loading a second copy, lists installed models first, and
  adds a "Same as the MTPLX app" option. `mtplx stop` knows the app's
  persisted port.
- New commands: `mtplx stop`, `mtplx settings get/set`, and
  `mtplx bench aime` for running the app's AIME benchmark from the
  terminal.
- Sparkle automatic app updates with signed appcasts; the app verifies
  the installed engine against the shipped wheel and refreshes it after
  each update.

### Changed

- Busy ports are now handled gracefully everywhere: the app moves to the
  next free port with a banner (and persists it), and the CLI explains
  exactly who owns a busy port and how to stop it.
- The OpenAI-compatible server honors `stop` sequences (chat,
  completions, and Anthropic `stop_sequences`) and `/v1/completions`
  streams tokens as they are generated with real finish reasons.
- AIME benchmark prompts now carry only the answer-format contract, with
  no solution-strategy or style coaching, and every run records the
  exact prompts and rescue policy in its summary for reproducibility.
- The daemon watchdog flags a server that is alive but not serving
  within about 35 seconds instead of letting it sit healthy-looking.

### Fixed

- Forced final-answer agent turns no longer leak internal rehearsal text
  or drop tools mid-conversation.
- The Qwen 3.6 35B speed preset applies its measured draft sampler unless
  explicitly overridden.
- Skipping the tuning step during onboarding no longer skips runtime
  installation.
- A previously tuned depth from one model no longer leaks into another
  model's launch settings.
